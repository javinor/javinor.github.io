# 7±2 Reasons Psychology Will Help You Write Better Code

During the Cold War, the CIA knew how to expose Russian spies disguised as American citizens with 100% certainty. They used only a piece of paper and a few questions. How did they do that? Hacking your mind is easier than you think.

Let’s explore how these mental hacks affect the code we all read and write. We’ll take a stroll through the world of cognitive and social psychology, and shed some light on some of our industry’s best and worst practices.

We’ll have a few interactive examples of our mind’s limitations, examine how these limitations manifest themselves in real code samples and engineering practices, and take away scientifically backed techniques on how to write better code.

# Domain Modeling with Types

Saying hammers are meant to drive nails into walls in short-sighted. That is what they do, not what they are meant for. They’re meant for building things! Type Systems are not meant to catch bugs, but for building quality software.

Let’s talk about an under appreciated strength of Type Systems. They shine by telling a coherent story about your code and the domain in which it lives. We’ll see examples and understand some ideas of domain modelling with types, which can be implemented in any language of your choice."


# Every Repo Tells a Story

Imagine waking up in the middle of the wilderness. No idea where you are, no clue where to go, no one around to help. Helpless, alone and miserable, you find yourself wasting hours wandering through unknown wastelands.

All of us know that feeling - it pops up when you need to make a small change to an unknown repo, because it's blocking the task you're working on. Or when debugging an urgent issue at 2am, only to find yourself stepping into another team's code base that you depend on. Is it worth making this journey easier for other developers, including your future self? Probably. But how? 

In this talk, Jonathan will share insights on code readability, past experiences in other teams and companies, a few real code examples and offer a couple of low cost tools to help make all our lives just a little bit easier.

# Do Your Tests Spark Joy?

Do you trust your tests? Do you sleep well at night when you’re on urgent duty? If you re-write a module from scratch, and all your tests pass, are you comfortable GAing? Testing is hard, no matter how you do it.

At Corvid by Wix, we’re avid supporters of Blackbox Testing. We firmly believe the benefits outweigh the costs, and this is not just a belief; for almost 4 years, it has proven itself in practice. 

We’d like to share our story. We’ll talk about what Blackbox Testing is all about, describe in detail how our testing infrastructure evolved over time, and why we were able to rewrite major chunks of our applications quickly, confidently and sleep well at night.
