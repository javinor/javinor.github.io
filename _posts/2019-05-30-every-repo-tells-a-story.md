Imagine waking up in the middle of the wilderness. No idea where you are, no clue where to go, no one around to help. Helpless, alone and miserable, you find yourself wasting hours wandering through unknown wastelands.

All of us know that feeling - it pops up when you need to make a small change to an unknown repo, because it's blocking the task you're working on. Or when debugging an urgent issue at 2am, only to find yourself stepping into another team's code base that you depend on. Is it worth making this journey easier for other developers, including your future self? Probably. But how? 

In this talk, Jonathan will share insights on code readability, past experiences in other teams and companies, a few real code examples and offer a couple of low cost tools to help make all our lives just a little bit easier.
