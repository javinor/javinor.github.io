The Rubik’s cube is one of the most famous games around the world. Innocent at first, you quickly realize you've been ambushed.

I invite you on a short journey of play, questions and looking at this ancient puzzle from a unique and fresh point of view. We'll peek at the underlying idea of existing solutions to the cube, and how new solutions are generated.

The workshop is appropriate for all, no prior knowledge required. We'll have cubes available, but feel free to bring your own.
