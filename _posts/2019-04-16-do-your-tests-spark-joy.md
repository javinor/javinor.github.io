Do you trust your tests? Do you sleep well at night when you’re on urgent duty? If you re-write a module from scratch, and all your tests pass, are you comfortable GAing? Testing is hard, no matter how you do it.

At Corvid by Wix, we’re avid supporters of Blackbox Testing. We firmly believe the benefits outweigh the costs, and this is not just a belief; for almost 4 years, it has proven itself in practice. 

We’d like to share our story. We’ll talk about what Blackbox Testing is all about, describe in detail how our testing infrastructure evolved over time, and why we were able to rewrite major chunks of our applications quickly, confidently and sleep well at night.
